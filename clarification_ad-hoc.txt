please note that once you download the files in your local directory, you will need to change the paths described in the
"configuration.py" file, in order to match the ones for your local directories, for MAC or Windows.
to retreive your active local directory where you desire to run the code from, 

please type : "pwd" (on your Jupyter notebook or CLI) and replace the below paths with your new ones:

DB_PATH_INIT = 'C:\\Users\\romeo\\Desktop\\romanos\\codebase\\Datasets\\initial'
DB_PATH_PREPRO = 'C:\\Users\\romeo\\Desktop\\romanos\\codebase\\Datasets\\generated'
DB_PATH_FEATURES = 'C:\\Users\\romeo\\Desktop\\romanos\\codebase\\Datasets\\features'
